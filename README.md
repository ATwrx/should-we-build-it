Should We Build It 
==================

This app was created to answer the age old question of "should I build it?". 

The goal of this project is to give developers a space to share idea's, seek contributers, and just see if the project is even worth the effort. 


To contribute: 
---------------

First install yarn. 

#### To see if you already have yarn installed

```
yarn -v
```

If you get a version number then it's already installed.

#### Install yarn & graphcool cli tool

```
npm i -g yarn
npm i -g graphcool
```

#### 

```
git clone https://github.com/ATwrx/should-we-build-it
```

Now, to start the client 

```
cd should-we-build-it/client
yarn install
yarn start
```

If you'd like to see the grapgql playground:

```
cd should-we-build-it/server
yarn install 
graphcool playground
```

#### You're all set
