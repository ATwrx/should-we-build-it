Should We Build It 
==================

This app was created to answer the age old question of "should I build it?". 

The goal of this project is to give developers a space to share idea's, seek contributers, and just see if the project is even worth the effort. 


To get started: 
---------------

First install yarn. 
`npm i -g yarn'

Then 
`yarn install` 

Lastly
`yarn start` 

This will start your dev server.
