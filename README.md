Should We Build It 
==================

This app was created to answer the age old question of "should I build it?". 

The goal of this project is to give developers a space to share idea's, seek contributers, and just see if the project is even worth the effort. 


To contribute: 
---------------

First install yarn. 

#### To see if you already have yarn installed

```
yarn -v
```

If you get a version number then it's already installed.

#### Install yarn

```
npm i -g yarn
```

#### Once yarn is installed

```
git clone https://github.com/ATwrx/should-we-build-it
cd should-we-build-it
yarn install
```

#### You're all set

```
yarn start 
```

This will start your dev server. 


### Better Documention in the future.... 

if using sequelize then node server.js followed by $ node_modules/.bin/sequelize db:seed:all will create the db and seed some basic data
